This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Edamame Legal Flow** is an AI-powered case and task management platform for Australian/NZ immigration lawyers and study abroad agencies. It replaces fragmented, rule-based tools with intelligent automation — users describe a case, select a workflow template, and Gemini AI generates a structured task schedule.

The product targets a gap in the AU immigration SaaS market: no incumbent offers AI-powered document processing, applicant self-service, or multi-jurisdiction support. See `EDAMAME BIG DECK.pptx` for competitive analysis, feature gap analysis, and phased roadmap.

## Strategic Context (from Pitch Deck)

- **Target market:** AU/NZ immigration practitioners (sole agents to enterprise firms)
- **Key competitors:** Migration Manager (AU incumbent), Officio (CA+AU), Clio (legal platform), Smokeball (general legal PM)
- **Differentiation pillars:** AI-first workflow engine, client self-service portal, regulatory intelligence, multi-jurisdiction support
- **Pricing model:** $65–$135/user/mo tiered (Essentials/Professional/Enterprise) + usage-based AI credits
- **Phased roadmap:** Phase 1 (0–6mo) foundation + VEVO/ImmiAccount integration, Phase 2 (6–12mo) AI layer + NZ expansion, Phase 3 (12–18mo) scale + marketplace

## Development Commands

All commands run from `src/` directory:

```bash
cd src
npm install
npm run dev       # Vite dev server on port 3000
npm run build     # Production build
npm run preview   # Preview production build
npm run lint      # TypeScript type check (tsc --noEmit)
```

Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `src/.env.local`.

Auth requires `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `src/.env.local` (get these from your Supabase project's Settings → API page). Without them, the app still loads but `signUp`/`signIn` calls fail with a network error — `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` falls back to a placeholder URL rather than crashing on load, and logs a console error.

## Architecture

### Dual Runtime Model

- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript SPA, built with Vite 6. Tailwind CSS via CDN (config inline in `src/index.html`).
- **Backend:** Vercel serverless functions in root `api/` directory (not `src/api/`):
  - `/api/generate-tasks.ts` — generates task schedules from case descriptions using Gemini 3.5 Flash
  - `/api/scan-passport-gemini.ts` — extracts passport data from images using Gemini Vision API
  - `/api/check-eligibility.ts` — assesses visa eligibility using Gemini 3.5 Flash with structured JSON schema

### State Management

All app state (tasks, cases, clients, templates, theme) lives in `src/App.tsx` as React `useState` hooks. Pages receive data and mutation callbacks as props — no state library. Theme persists to `localStorage`.

### Navigation

`ViewMode` union type (`'dashboard' | 'clients' | 'cases' | 'case-details' | 'templates' | 'settings'`) drives which page renders. `Sidebar.tsx` controls view switching.

### AI Task Generation Flow

1. User opens case in CaseDetails, clicks "Generate Tasks"
2. `geminiService.ts` POSTs case description + workflow guide + start date to `/api/generate-tasks`
3. Vercel function sends prompt to Gemini with structured JSON schema (title, description, daysOffset)
4. Response parsed into `Task[]` with computed dates and added to app state

### Passport Scanner (OCR) Flow

1. User clicks "Scan Passport" in NewCase/Clients form
2. `PassportScanner.tsx` component opens modal, accepts drag-drop or file upload
3. Image converted to base64 and POSTed to `/api/scan-passport-gemini` via `ocrService.ts`
4. Vercel function calls Gemini Vision API with inline image data
5. Extracted fields (firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, nationality, passportNumber, expiryDate, gender) returned
6. User can edit fields before confirming to populate form
7. Error state offers "Continue with Manual Entry" fallback

### Authentication Flow

Registration/login gates the **entire app** (not just cloud storage mode) via Supabase Auth (email/password).

1. `AuthProvider` (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) wraps the whole router in `App.tsx`, resolving `supabase.auth.getSession()` on mount and subscribing to `onAuthStateChange`.
2. `ProtectedRoute` (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`) reads `useAuth()` — redirects to `/login` if no session, shows a spinner while `loading` is true. It gates `/onboarding` and the `/*` app-shell route; `/`, `/login`, `/register` stay public.
3. `pages/Register.tsx` calls `signUp(email, password, fullName)` — full name is stored in Supabase's `user_metadata.full_name` (no separate `profiles` table). If Supabase requires email confirmation, the page shows a "check your email" state instead of navigating away.
4. `pages/Login.tsx` calls `signIn(email, password)`, with a "Forgot password?" link that calls `resetPassword(email)`.
5. Sign-out is available both in `pages/Settings.tsx` (Account section) and as a link in `components/Sidebar.tsx` — both call `signOut()` then navigate to `/login`.

**Important:** Auth (who you are) and `StorageMode` (`'local' | 'cloud'`, where your data lives) are independent axes, chosen at `/onboarding` and persisted in the `profiles` table (see "Local-First Storage" below). Cloud storage mode is not implemented yet — selecting it lands on a "not available yet" placeholder in `App.tsx`'s `StorageGate`; there is no more silent fallback to local.

`currentUserId` in `App.tsx` is the authenticated Supabase `user.id` (via `useAuth()`) — used for `assignedTo`/`actorId` on tasks and activity events, and as the id of the "you" entry seeded into Team Members.

### Local-First Storage

**No app data lives in the browser.** Local mode stores every record as a JSON file in a real folder on disk that the user links via the File System Access API (Chrome/Edge only) — not IndexedDB, not `localStorage`, not OPFS. The intent: a lawyer with multiple machines points the app at a folder inside Dropbox/OneDrive/iCloud Drive and that folder *is* their data, portable across devices without a server. Cloud mode (Supabase Postgres tables) is the other, not-yet-built half of this same split.

- **`profiles` table** (Supabase, migration at `supabase/migrations/20260722000000_create_profiles.sql`, RLS-scoped to `auth.uid()`) holds account-level settings that must follow the user regardless of device: `storage_mode`, `theme`, `sidebar_collapsed`, plus `linked_folder_name`/`linked_at` for display. `services/profileService.ts` wraps reads/writes; `contexts/ProfileContext.tsx` fetches it right after login and exposes `useProfile()`.
- **The one sanctioned browser-side exception**: a `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` is a browser-native object that can't be serialized to Supabase or a file, so the permission handle to reconnect to the linked folder is persisted client-side in a dedicated IndexedDB store, `lib/folderHandleStore.ts` (one record per `userId`, holds no case data). `contexts/LocalFolderContext.tsx` owns the link/reconnect/redirect lifecycle (`linkFolder`, `reconnect`, `changeFolder`) and exposes a `status` (`'unlinked' | 'needs-permission' | 'ready'` etc.) that `App.tsx`'s `StorageGate` uses to show `components/LinkFolderGate.tsx` instead of the app shell until access is granted.
- **Repositories** (`repositories/filesystem/index.ts`): `createFilesystemRepositories(rootHandle)` implements the same `Repositories` interface as before (`repositories/types.ts`), backed by `lib/fsStorage.ts` (a File System Access API wrapper — `writeJson`/`readJson`/`writeBlob`/`readBlob`/`listFiles`/`copyTree`, etc.) instead of Dexie/OPFS. Every entity gets one JSON file per record (`clients/{id}.json`, `cases/{id}.json`, ...), chosen deliberately over a single DB file so that if the linked folder is synced via Dropbox/OneDrive and two machines write near-simultaneously, the conflict is scoped to one record instead of the whole dataset. `activity-events/` is append-only, one file per event (`{isoTimestamp}-{eventId}.json`), for the same reason. Document file bytes live at `Document.filePath` as real files (set by `components/DocumentUpload.tsx`), replacing the old OPFS-backed blob store. Team Members, the Activity Feed, per-case Document Checklists, and Focus Mode Chat now go through this same repository layer (`repos.teamMembers`, `repos.activity`, `repos.checklist`, `repos.chat`) instead of ad hoc `localStorage`. Since a linked folder belongs to exactly one user by construction, there's no per-row `userId` ownership check the way the old Dexie repositories needed.
- **Settings → Data Storage** (`pages/Settings.tsx`) shows the linked folder and a "Change Folder" button (`LocalFolderContext.changeFolder()`): picking an empty target copies the existing folder's contents over via `copyTree`; picking a folder that already has Edamame data in it (e.g. a second machine linking to an already-synced folder) adopts it as-is rather than overwriting.
- **No migration path** from the old Dexie/localStorage era — this was a clean cutover with no existing users at the time.

**Production:** Supabase project `edamame-legal-flow` (wandering-pork's Org) backs both dev and prod. Its Auth → URL Configuration Site URL is `https://edemame.vercel.app`, with `https://edemame.vercel.app/**` and `http://localhost:3000/**` allow-listed as redirect URLs. The Vercel project `edemame` has `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set for Production + Preview. The `profiles` table migration must be applied manually (Supabase SQL editor, or `supabase db push` once the CLI is linked to the project) — it was not applied automatically.

### Visa Eligibility Advisor Flow

1. User navigates to Visa Advisor page (sidebar or "Check Eligibility" button on client card)
2. 4-step wizard collects: personal info → immigration goal → conditional details → supporting factors
3. On submit, POSTs collected data to `/api/check-eligibility` via `VisaAdvisor.tsx`
4. Vercel function calls Gemini 3.5 Flash with visa assessment prompt
5. Returns JSON with visa verdict cards: 9 Australian visa subclasses (189, 190, 482, 186, 500, 820, 485, 600, 417)
6. Each card shows verdict (qualifies/possibly/unlikely/needs_more_info), reasons, and gaps
7. "Open New Case" button on qualified visas navigates to CaseManager with template pre-selected via URL state

### Key Conventions

- `src/components/` — reusable brand/layout pieces (Logo, Sidebar, PassportScanner, ProtectedRoute)
- `src/pages/` — page-level views (Dashboard, CaseManager, CaseDetails, NewCase, Clients, VisaAdvisor, Templates, Settings, Login, Register, Onboarding, LandingPage)
- `src/services/` — external API client functions (geminiService, ocrService)
- `src/contexts/` — React context providers (`AuthContext`, `RepositoryContext`, `SidebarContext`)
- `src/repositories/` — storage abstraction (`filesystem/` = File System Access API-backed local mode, `cloud/` = not-yet-implemented Supabase stub, `factory.ts` picks based on `StorageMode`)
- `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` — Supabase client singleton, used by `AuthContext` (and eventually `repositories/cloud/`)
- `api/` — **root-level** Vercel serverless functions (not `src/api/`) — server-side, runs on Node
- `src/types.ts` — all TypeScript type definitions (Task, Case, Client, WorkflowTemplate, ViewMode, Theme, StorageMode)
- Path alias `@/` resolves to `src/` root

### Styling

- Brand color: `#29B767` (edamame green), aliased as `edamame-*` in Tailwind config
- Dark mode: class-based (`dark:` prefix), toggled via `Theme` type
- Brand fonts: Sniglet (logo), Fredoka (headings)
- Dependencies loaded via import maps from `aistudiocdn.com` (Google AI Studio origin)

### Seed Data

Hardcoded in `App.tsx`: 5 clients, 4 cases, 8 tasks, 5 Australian visa workflow templates (Student 500, Skilled 190, Partner 820/801, Visitor 600, Graduate 485). No persistence layer yet — state resets on reload.
