# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Edamame Legal Flow** is an AI-powered case and task management platform for Australian/NZ immigration lawyers and study abroad agencies. It replaces fragmented, rule-based tools with intelligent automation — users describe a case, select a workflow template, and Gemini AI generates a structured task schedule.

The product targets a gap in the AU immigration SaaS market: no incumbent offers AI-powered document processing, applicant self-service, or multi-jurisdiction support. See `EDAMAME BIG DECK.pptx` for competitive analysis, feature gap analysis, and phased roadmap.

## Strategic Context (from Pitch Deck)

- **Target market:** AU/NZ immigration practitioners (sole agents to enterprise firms)
- **Key competitors:** Migration Manager (AU incumbent), Officio (CA+AU), Clio (legal platform), Smokeball (general legal PM)
- **Differentiation pillars:** AI-first workflow engine, client self-service portal, regulatory intelligence, multi-jurisdiction support
- **Pricing model:** $65–$135/user/mo tiered (Essentials/Professional/Enterprise) + usage-based AI credits
- **Phased roadmap:** Phase 1 (0–6mo) foundation + VEVO/ImmiAccount integration, Phase 2 (6–12mo) AI layer + NZ expansion, Phase 3 (12–18mo) scale + marketplace

## Development Commands

All commands run from `src/` directory:

```bash
cd src
npm install
npm run dev       # Vite dev server on port 3000
npm run build     # Production build
npm run preview   # Preview production build
npm run lint      # TypeScript type check (tsc --noEmit)
```

Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `src/.env.local`.

## Architecture

### Dual Runtime Model

- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript SPA, built with Vite 6. Tailwind CSS via CDN (config inline in `src/index.html`).
- **Backend:** Vercel serverless functions in root `api/` directory (not `src/api/`):
  - `/api/generate-tasks.ts` — generates task schedules from case descriptions using Gemini 2.5 Flash
  - `/api/scan-passport-gemini.ts` — extracts passport data from images using Gemini Vision API
  - `/api/check-eligibility.ts` — assesses visa eligibility using Gemini 2.5 Flash with structured JSON schema

### State Management

All app state (tasks, cases, clients, templates, theme) lives in `src/App.tsx` as React `useState` hooks. Pages receive data and mutation callbacks as props — no state library. Theme persists to `localStorage`.

### Navigation

`ViewMode` union type (`'dashboard' | 'clients' | 'cases' | 'case-details' | 'templates' | 'settings'`) drives which page renders. `Sidebar.tsx` controls view switching.

### AI Task Generation Flow

1. User opens case in CaseDetails, clicks "Generate Tasks"
2. `geminiService.ts` POSTs case description + workflow guide + start date to `/api/generate-tasks`
3. Vercel function sends prompt to Gemini with structured JSON schema (title, description, daysOffset)
4. Response parsed into `Task[]` with computed dates and added to app state

### Passport Scanner (OCR) Flow

1. User clicks "Scan Passport" in NewCase/Clients form
2. `PassportScanner.tsx` component opens modal, accepts drag-drop or file upload
3. Image converted to base64 and POSTed to `/api/scan-passport-gemini` via `ocrService.ts`
4. Vercel function calls Gemini Vision API with inline image data
5. Extracted fields (firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, nationality, passportNumber, expiryDate, gender) returned
6. User can edit fields before confirming to populate form
7. Error state offers "Continue with Manual Entry" fallback

### Visa Eligibility Advisor Flow

1. User navigates to Visa Advisor page (sidebar or "Check Eligibility" button on client card)
2. 4-step wizard collects: personal info → immigration goal → conditional details → supporting factors
3. On submit, POSTs collected data to `/api/check-eligibility` via `VisaAdvisor.tsx`
4. Vercel function calls Gemini 2.5 Flash with visa assessment prompt
5. Returns JSON with visa verdict cards: 9 Australian visa subclasses (189, 190, 482, 186, 500, 820, 485, 600, 417)
6. Each card shows verdict (qualifies/possibly/unlikely/needs_more_info), reasons, and gaps
7. "Open New Case" button on qualified visas navigates to CaseManager with template pre-selected via URL state

### Key Conventions

- `src/components/` — reusable brand/layout pieces (Logo, Sidebar, PassportScanner)
- `src/pages/` — page-level views (Dashboard, CaseManager, CaseDetails, NewCase, Clients, VisaAdvisor, Templates, Settings)
- `src/services/` — external API client functions (geminiService, ocrService)
- `api/` — **root-level** Vercel serverless functions (not `src/api/`) — server-side, runs on Node
- `src/types.ts` — all TypeScript type definitions (Task, Case, Client, WorkflowTemplate, ViewMode, Theme)
- Path alias `@/` resolves to `src/` root

### Styling

- Brand color: `#29B767` (edamame green), aliased as `edamame-*` in Tailwind config
- Dark mode: class-based (`dark:` prefix), toggled via `Theme` type
- Brand fonts: Sniglet (logo), Fredoka (headings)
- Dependencies loaded via import maps from `aistudiocdn.com` (Google AI Studio origin)

### Seed Data

Hardcoded in `App.tsx`: 5 clients, 4 cases, 8 tasks, 5 Australian visa workflow templates (Student 500, Skilled 190, Partner 820/801, Visitor 600, Graduate 485). No persistence layer yet — state resets on reload.
